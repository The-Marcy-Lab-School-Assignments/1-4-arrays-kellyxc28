# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
`favoriteLocations` changed because arrays pass references. In this case, even though `locations` (line 14) is not the same as `favoriteLocations` (line 13) in wording, `favoriteLocations` is referencing the array it is assigned to.  

`name` was not changed because it is a primitive type (string) and it passes immutable values. "mike" cannot be reassigned as "tom".
