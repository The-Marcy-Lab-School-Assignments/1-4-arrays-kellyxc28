# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer
I do not think so because changes or side effects are implemented on the array itself. If it was impure, a copy would have been made first and then the changes are made on the copied array.

You're correct however you used the wrong word in the second sentence, remember that it is pure functions that make the copy not the impure ones!
