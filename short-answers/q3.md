# Question
Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer
They are different because the spread operator can be used to make a copy of an array. On the other hand, the rest operator is used to enable a function to take in an indefinite number of inputs and put them in an array.
